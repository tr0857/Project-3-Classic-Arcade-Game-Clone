write collisions function: if x and y coordinates match then you call reset.  Add the x position plus the bugs width. to find the nose of bug. Find x position of player. Check if player is on dangerous road. If so check if the nose of the bug is greater then the top left corner of my playa.

		Alternate code for changes in bug speed-
		if(this.x<505){
		   this.x+=((Math.random() * (600 - 200) + 200)*dt);

		    this.x=-100;
		}
